It can exist in various forms, such as numbers, text, images, audio, video, or signals. Data is often collected or generated through observation, measurement, or experimentation. Data, in itself, has no inherent meaning or context.\n\n*   **Characteristics:**\n    *   Raw and unorganized\n    *   Lacks context and meaning\n    *   Can be quantitative or qualitative\n    *   Collected through observation, measurement, or experimentation\n    *   Stored in various formats (e.g., tables, files, databases)\n\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   A list of temperature readings in Celsius for a city, such as: 25, 27, 29, 26, 24\n    *   A collection of customer names and addresses stored in a database.\n    *   A series of audio samples recorded by a microphone.\n    *   A set of images captured by a camera.\n\n**Information:**\n\n*   **Definition:** Information is data that has been processed, organized, structured, and given context to make it meaningful and useful for decision-making. Information answers questions like \"who,\" \"what,\" \"where,\" \"when,\" and \"how many.\"\n\n*   **Characteristics:**\n    *   Processed, organized, and structured\n    *   Provides context and meaning\n    *   Answers questions about the data\n    *   Useful for decision-making, analysis, and communication\n    *   Can be derived from data through analysis, interpretation, and summarization\n\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   The average temperature for the city based on the raw temperature readings.\n    *   A report showing the total sales by product category for a specific month.\n    *   A graph visualizing the trend of website traffic over time.\n    *   A summary of customer demographics based on data from a database.\n\n**Key Differences between Data and Information:**\n\nThe easiest way to think of the difference is to consider that data needs to be worked upon to become information.\n\n| Feature         | Data                               | Information                                         |\n| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |\n| State           | Raw, unorganized                    | Processed, organized, structured                     |\n| Context         | Lacks context and meaning           | Provides context and meaning                         |\n| Purpose         | Storage, collection                  | Analysis, decision-making, communication            |\n| Format          | Various (numbers, text, images)   | Meaningful and understandable                        |\n| Example         | Temperature readings: 25, 27, 29  | Average temperature: 26.2 Â°C                      |\n| Dependency      | It is fundamental and basic.       | It is reliant on the processing and interpretation of data. |\n\n**Analogy:**\n\nThink of data as the ingredients for a recipe. On their own, flour, eggs, and sugar are just raw materials. Information is the final baked cake that you understand, eat, and enjoy.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nData is the foundation upon which information is built. Data needs to be processed and transformed to become information, which is meaningful and useful for decision-making.\n\n## Overview of Modern Data Analytic Tools\n\nData analytics has become an integral part of decision-making across various industries.
